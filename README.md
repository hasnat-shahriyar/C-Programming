# Roadmap to Master C Programming

Welcome to the C Programming Repository! This guide will take you through a structured approach to learning C programming. You can navigate through the **C-Practice Modules** to focus on specific topics.

## C-Practice

### Module-1

- [Basic Syntax, Variables, and Data Types | Memory Management and Format Specifiers](https://github.com/hasnat-shahriyar/C-Programming/tree/main/C-Practice/Module-1)

### Module-2

- [Operators and Conditional Statements](https://github.com/hasnat-shahriyar/C-Programming/tree/main/C-Practice/Module-2)

### Module-3

- [Loops](https://github.com/hasnat-shahriyar/C-Programming/tree/main/C-Practice/Module-3)

### Module-4

- [Unary Operators | Increment and Decrement](https://github.com/hasnat-shahriyar/C-Programming/tree/main/C-Practice/Module-4)

### Module-5

- [Arrays](https://github.com/hasnat-shahriyar/C-Programming/tree/main/C-Practice/Module-5)

### Module-6

- [Array Operations | Remove, Reverse, and Copy](https://github.com/hasnat-shahriyar/C-Programming/tree/main/C-Practice/Module-6)

### Module-7

- [Strings](https://github.com/hasnat-shahriyar/C-Programming/tree/main/C-Practice/Module-7)

### Module-8

- [String Operations and Frequency Array | Copy, Lexicographical Comparison, Concatenation, Counting Array](https://github.com/hasnat-shahriyar/C-Programming/tree/main/C-Practice/Module-8)
