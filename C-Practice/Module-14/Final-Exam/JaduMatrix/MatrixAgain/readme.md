```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int row, col;

    // Input row and column
    scanf("%d %d", &row, &col);

    // Declare a 2D matrix
    int matrix[row][col];

    // Input elements into the matrix
    for (int i = 0; i < row; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < col; j++) {
            scanf("%d", &matrix[i][j]);
        }
    }

    // Printing the last row
    for (int j = 0; j < col; j++) {
        printf("%d ", matrix[row - 1][j]);
    }
    printf("\n");

    // Printing the last column except for the last element
    for (int i = 0; i < row - 1; i++) {
        printf("%d ", matrix[i][col - 1]);
    }
    // Printing the last element of the last column
    printf("%d\n", matrix[row - 1][col - 1]);

    return 0;
}
```

### Printing the Last Row:

```c
// Printing the last row
for (int j = 0; j < col; j++) {
    printf("%d ", matrix[row - 1][j]);
}
printf("\n");
```

In this part, the program iterates over each column (`j`) of the last row (`row - 1`) of the matrix and prints the corresponding element. After printing all elements of the last row, it adds a newline character (`\n`) to move to the next line.

Let's visualize with Sample Input 0:

```
3 4
1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
6 5 4 2
```

The last row is `[6 5 4 2]`. The loop iterates over each element in this row and prints them separated by a space, followed by a newline character.

### Printing the Last Column:

```c
// Printing the last column except for the last element
for (int i = 0; i < row - 1; i++) {
    printf("%d ", matrix[i][col - 1]);
}
// Printing the last element of the last column
printf("%d\n", matrix[row - 1][col - 1]);
```

In this part, the program first iterates over each row except the last one (`i < row - 1`) and prints the element located in the last column (`col - 1`) of each row. After printing all elements except for the last one, it prints the last element of the last column (`matrix[row - 1][col - 1]`).

Let's visualize with Sample Input 0:

```
3 4
1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
6 5 4 2
```

The last column (excluding the last element) is `[4 8]`. The loop iterates over each row except the last one and prints these elements. Then it prints the last element of the last column, which is `2`.

This C program takes as input the dimensions of a 2D matrix (`row` and `col`), followed by the elements of the matrix. Then, it prints the values of the last row followed by the values of the last column.

Let's break down the code and see how it works:

1. The program starts by reading two integers, `row` and `col`, representing the number of rows and columns in the matrix, respectively.

2. Then, it declares a 2D array `matrix[row][col]` to store the elements of the matrix.

3. Next, the program reads the elements of the matrix using nested loops. The outer loop iterates over each row (`i`), and the inner loop iterates over each column (`j`), storing the input values in the `matrix` array.

4. After inputting all the elements, the program proceeds to print the values of the last row. It does this by iterating over the columns of the last row (`row - 1`) and printing each element separated by a space.

5. After printing the last row, the program prints the values of the last column. It iterates over each row except the last one (`i < row - 1`) and prints the element located in the last column (`col - 1`) of each row, followed by a space. Finally, it prints the element located in the bottom-right corner of the matrix (`matrix[row - 1][col - 1]`).

Let's visualize how the sample inputs are processed by the program:

### Sample Input 0:

```
3 4
1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
6 5 4 2
```

### Sample Output 0:

```
6 5 4 2
4 8 2
```

### Sample Input 1:

```
5 3
1 2 3
5 6 7
6 5 4
3 5 4
1 2 3
```

### Sample Output 1:

```
1 2 3
3 7 4 4 3
```

The program correctly prints the values of the last row and last column, as per the problem statement. If you have any further questions or need additional clarification, feel free to ask!
