```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    char a[100];
    scanf("%s", &a);
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; a[i] != '\0'; i++) {
        count++;
    }
    printf("%d\n", count);
    return 0;
}
```

1. **Initializing Variables**:

   - `char a[100];`: Declares an array of characters named `a`, capable of holding up to 100 characters.
   - `int count = 0;`: Initializes a variable `count` to zero, which will count the number of characters in the input string.

2. **Reading Input**:

   - `scanf("%s", &a);`: Reads a string input from the user and stores it in the array `a`.

3. **Counting Characters**:

   - `for (int i = 0; a[i] != '\0'; i++) { ... }`: Iterates over each character of the string stored in `a` until encountering the null character `'\0'`, which marks the end of the string.
   - `count++;`: Increments `count` by one for each character encountered (excluding the null character).

4. **Visualizing the Iteration**:

   - Iterating through the string "Hasnat":
     ```
     Iteration 1: i = 0, a[0] = 'H', count = 1
     Iteration 2: i = 1, a[1] = 'a', count = 2
     Iteration 3: i = 2, a[2] = 's', count = 3
     Iteration 4: i = 3, a[3] = 'n', count = 4
     Iteration 5: i = 4, a[4] = 'a', count = 5
     Iteration 6: i = 5, a[5] = 't', count = 6
     Iteration 7: i = 6, a[6] = '\0', loop terminates
     ```

5. **Printing the Count**:
   - `printf("%d\n", count);`: Prints the total count of characters in the input string (`count`).

---

This code reads a string from input, counts the number of characters in it, and prints the count. The loop iterates through each character of the string until encountering the null character `'\0'`. The `count++` statement increments the count for each character encountered, effectively tallying the total number of characters. Finally, `printf()` prints the count.
