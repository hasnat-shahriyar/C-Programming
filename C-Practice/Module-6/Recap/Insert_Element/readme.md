Explanation:

1. The code starts by including the standard input-output library `stdio.h`.
2. In the `main()` function, it declares variables `n`, `pos`, and `value`.
3. It reads the size of the array `n` from the user input.
4. It declares an integer array `ar` of size `n+1` to accommodate an additional element.
5. It then reads `n` elements into the array `ar` from the user input.
6. It reads the position (`pos`) and value (`value`) of the element to be inserted into the array.
7. It shifts the elements of the array to the right, starting from the end, to make space for the new element to be inserted at the specified position.
8. It inserts the value at the specified position.
9. Finally, it prints the modified array.

Given the input:

```
5
10 20 30 40 50
1 100
```

The output would be:

```
10 100 20 30 40 50
```

This is because `100` is inserted at position `1` (0-based indexing) shifting the original element at position `1` and beyond to the right.

#

Suppose we have the following input:

```
5
10 20 30 40 50
1 100
```

Now, let's explain the loop `for (int i = n; i >= pos+1; i--)` with an input visualization:

1. We start with `i = n`, which is equal to the size of the array, i.e., `5` in this case.
2. The loop condition checks if `i` is greater than or equal to `pos + 1`.
   - Here, `pos + 1` is `1 + 1 = 2`. So, the loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `2`.
   - This means the loop will stop when `i` becomes `1`.
3. In each iteration of the loop, `i` is decremented (`i--`).
4. During each iteration, the loop shifts the elements of the array to the right, starting from index `n` (the last element).
5. It continues this process until `i` reaches `1` (the position before the specified position to insert the new element).
6. At this point, the loop stops, and the new element is inserted at the specified position.

Visualizing the loop iterations:

- **Initial State:** `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50, ?]` (The '?' represents the empty space for the new element)

- **Iteration 1 (i = 5):** Shift the element at index `4` to index `5`:
  `[10, 20, 30, 40, ?, 50]`

- **Iteration 2 (i = 4):** Shift the element at index `3` to index `4`:
  `[10, 20, 30, ?, 40, 50]`

- **Iteration 3 (i = 3):** Shift the element at index `2` to index `3`:
  `[10, 20, ?, 30, 40, 50]`

- **Iteration 4 (i = 2):** Since `i` (2) is no longer greater than or equal to `pos + 1` (2), the loop stops.

Now, the array looks like this after shifting, but before inserting the new element:

```
[10, ?, 20, 30, 40, 50]
```

Finally, the new element (`100`) is inserted at the specified position `1`, and the array becomes:

```
[10, 100, 20, 30, 40, 50]
```

#

In the loop `ar[i] = ar[i-1];`, each iteration shifts the elements of the array `ar` one position to the right, starting from the index `i`. Let's break down what happens in each iteration:

- `ar[i]`: This represents the element at the current index `i`. During each iteration, this element is overwritten with the value of the element at the previous index.

- `ar[i-1]`: This represents the element at the index immediately before `i`. In other words, it represents the element that needs to be moved to index `i`.

Let's visualize how the elements are shifted:

Suppose we have an array `ar` with elements `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50, ?]`, and we want to insert a new element at position `pos = 1` with value `100`.

- **Iteration 1 (i = n):** `ar[i] = ar[i-1];`

  Before the iteration:

  ```
  [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, ?]
  ```

  After the iteration:

  ```
  [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 50]
  ```

- **Iteration 2 (i = n - 1):** `ar[i] = ar[i-1];`

  Before the iteration:

  ```
  [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 50]
  ```

  After the iteration:

  ```
  [10, 20, 30, 40, 40, 50]
  ```

- **Iteration 3 (i = n - 2):** `ar[i] = ar[i-1];`

  Before the iteration:

  ```
  [10, 20, 30, 40, 40, 50]
  ```

  After the iteration:

  ```
  [10, 20, 30, 30, 40, 50]
  ```

- **Iteration 4 (i = n - 3):** `ar[i] = ar[i-1];`

  Before the iteration:

  ```
  [10, 20, 30, 30, 40, 50]
  ```

  After the iteration:

  ```
  [10, 20, 20, 30, 40, 50]
  ```

- **Iteration 5 (i = n - 4):** `ar[i] = ar[i-1];`

  Before the iteration:

  ```
  [10, 20, 20, 30, 40, 50]
  ```

  After the iteration:

  ```
  [10, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
  ```

At this point, all elements have been shifted, creating space for the new element to be inserted at the specified position (`pos = 1`).

#

After shifting the elements to the right to make space for the new element, the code then inserts the value of the new element (`value`) at the specified position (`pos`) in the array `ar` using the line `ar[pos] = value;`.

Let's see how this works with the example:

Suppose we have an array `ar` with elements `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50, ?]`, and we want to insert a new element at position `pos = 1` with value `100`.

After shifting the elements, the array looks like this:

```
[10, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
```

Now, the code inserts the value `100` at the specified position `pos = 1`. The line `ar[pos] = value;` assigns `100` to `ar[1]`, replacing the existing value at that position:

Before insertion:

```
[10, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
```

After insertion:

```
[10, 100, 20, 30, 40, 50]
```

Now, the new element with the value `100` has been successfully inserted at the specified position `pos = 1`, and the array is updated accordingly.
