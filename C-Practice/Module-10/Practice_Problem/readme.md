```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function to convert a character to its ASCII value
int char_to_ascii(char c){
    return (int)c;
}

int main()
{
    // Declare a variable to store the input character
    char input_character;

    // Prompt the user to enter a character and read the input
    scanf("%c", &input_character);

    // Call the function char_to_ascii to convert the character to its ASCII value
    int ascii_value = char_to_ascii(input_character);

    // Print the ASCII value
    printf("%d\n", ascii_value);

    return 0;
}
```

This C code takes an input character from the user, converts it to its ASCII value, and then prints that ASCII value to the console.

Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code does:

1. **Header Inclusion**:

   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>
   ```

   This line includes the standard input-output library `stdio.h`, which provides functions like `scanf()` and `printf()`.

2. **Function Definition**:

   ```c
   int char_to_ascii(char c){
       return (int)c;
   }
   ```

   This function `char_to_ascii` takes a character `c` as input and returns its ASCII value as an integer. It simply typecasts the character to an integer, which implicitly converts its ASCII value.

3. **Main Function**:

   ```c
   int main()
   {
       char input_character;
       scanf("%c", &input_character);
   ```

   The `main()` function is the entry point of the program. It declares a variable `input_character` of type `char` to store the user's input character. Then, it uses `scanf()` to read a single character from the standard input (keyboard) and stores it in `input_character`.

4. **Function Call and Output**:

   ```c
       int ascii_value = char_to_ascii(input_character);
       printf("%d\n", ascii_value);
   ```

   Next, it calls the `char_to_ascii` function with `input_character` as an argument to get the ASCII value of the input character. Then, it prints the ASCII value to the console using `printf()`.

5. **Return Statement**:
   ```c
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   Finally, the `main()` function returns 0, indicating successful execution of the program. In C, returning 0 from `main()` typically indicates successful termination of the program.

So, when you run this program, it will prompt you to enter a character. After you input a character and press Enter, it will display the ASCII value of that character.
