```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int n, k = 1; // Declaring variables 'n' and 'k', initializing 'k' to 1
    scanf("%d", &n); // Taking input for 'n' from the user

    // Outer loop to iterate from 1 to 'n'
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    {
        // Inner loop to print numbers from 1 to 'k'
        for (int j = 1; j <= k; j++)
        {
            printf("%d ", j); // Printing the current value of 'j'
        }
        k++; // Incrementing 'k' for the next iteration
        printf("\n"); // Moving to the next line after printing all numbers from 1 to 'k'
    }
    return 0; // Indicating successful completion of the program
}
```

This code takes an integer input `n` from the user and then prints a pattern of numbers. In each row, it prints numbers from `1` to `k`, where `k` starts from `1` and increments by `1` in each row. The number of rows printed is determined by the input value of `n`.

Suppose, input is 5:

1. **Initialization:**

   - `n` is set to `5`, representing the number of rows to print.
   - `k` is initialized to `1`, representing the current row number.

2. **Printing the Pattern:**

   - The outer loop iterates over each row from `1` to `n`.
   - Inside the outer loop, there's an inner loop:
     - The inner loop prints numbers from `1` to the current row number (`k`).
     - It prints `j`, which starts from `1` and goes up to `k`.

3. **Output:**
   - After printing each row, `k` is incremented by `1`.
   - A newline character (`\n`) is printed to move to the next line.

Let's visualize each iteration:

1. **First Row (Iteration 1):**

   - `k = 1`, so the inner loop prints numbers from `1` to `1`.

   ```
   1
   ```

2. **Second Row (Iteration 2):**

   - `k` is incremented to `2`.
   - The inner loop prints numbers from `1` to `2`.

   ```
   1 2
   ```

3. **Third Row (Iteration 3):**

   - `k` is incremented to `3`.
   - The inner loop prints numbers from `1` to `3`.

   ```
   1 2 3
   ```

4. **Fourth Row (Iteration 4):**

   - `k` is incremented to `4`.
   - The inner loop prints numbers from `1` to `4`.

   ```
   1 2 3 4
   ```

5. **Fifth Row (Iteration 5):**
   - `k` is incremented to `5`.
   - The inner loop prints numbers from `1` to `5`.
   ```
   1 2 3 4 5
   ```

This code generates a pattern where each row contains numbers from `1` to the row number, forming a staircase-like pattern.
