Suppose, input 5:

1. **Initialization:**

   - `n` is set to `5`, representing the height of the pyramid.
   - `k` is initialized to `1`, representing the number of asterisks in the widest row.
   - `s` is initialized to `n - 1`, representing the number of spaces in the first row.

2. **Printing the Pyramid:**

   - The outer loop iterates `2 * n - 1` times, representing the total number of rows in the pyramid.

3. **Printing Each Row:**
   - Inside the loop:
     - The first inner loop prints the leading spaces before the asterisks.
     - The second inner loop prints the asterisks.
     - The conditions inside the loop control the decrement of spaces and increment/decrement of asterisks to achieve the pyramid shape.

Now, let's visualize each iteration:

1. **First Row (Iteration 1):**

   - `s = 4`, `k = 1`, so we print `4` spaces followed by `1` asterisk.

   ```
       *
   ```

2. **Second Row (Iteration 2):**

   - `s = 3`, `k = 3`, so we print `3` spaces followed by `3` asterisks.

   ```
      ***
   ```

3. **Third Row (Iteration 3):**

   - `s = 2`, `k = 5`, so we print `2` spaces followed by `5` asterisks.

   ```
     *****
   ```

4. **Fourth Row (Iteration 4):**

   - `s = 1`, `k = 7`, so we print `1` space followed by `7` asterisks.

   ```
    *******
   ```

5. **Fifth Row (Iteration 5):**

   - `s = 0`, `k = 9`, so we print `0` spaces followed by `9` asterisks.

   ```
   *********
   ```

6. **Rows 6 to 9:**

   - Now, the pyramid starts to decrease in width:
     - `s` starts incrementing back from `0`.
     - `k` starts decrementing from `9`.

7. **Tenth Row (Iteration 10):**

   - `s = 1`, `k = 7`, so we print `1` space followed by `7` asterisks.

   ```
    *******
   ```

8. **Eleventh Row (Iteration 11):**

   - `s = 2`, `k = 5`, so we print `2` spaces followed by `5` asterisks.

   ```
     *****
   ```

9. **Twelfth Row (Iteration 12):**

   - `s = 3`, `k = 3`, so we print `3` spaces followed by `3` asterisks.

   ```
      ***
   ```

10. **Thirteenth Row (Iteration 13):**
    - `s = 4`, `k = 1`, so we print `4` spaces followed by `1` asterisk.
    ```
       *
    ```

This pattern continues until the pyramid's base is reached.
