# Introduction to C Programming

Welcome to the Introduction to C Programming! In this directory, I'll cover some very basic fundamental concepts of C programming.

## Including Standard Input-Output Header

In C programming, the `#include <stdio.h>` directive is commonly used to include the standard input-output header file. This directive is a preprocessor command that instructs the compiler to include the contents of the `stdio.h` header file before compiling the program. Here's a breakdown:

### `#include <stdio.h>`

- This line is a preprocessor directive.
- It tells the compiler to include the `stdio.h` header file.
- `stdio.h` provides declarations for functions like `printf()` and `scanf()`, which are essential for input and output operations in C.

## Preprocessor Commands

C preprocessor commands begin with a `#` symbol. They are used for various tasks such as including header files, defining constants, and conditional compilation. Here's a brief overview:

- **Header Inclusion**: `#include <header_file>` is used to include header files.
- **Macro Definition**: `#define CONSTANT_NAME value` is used to define constants.
- **Conditional Compilation**: Directives like `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#if`, `#else`, and `#endif` are used for conditional compilation.
- **Text Substitution**: `#define` with macros is used for text substitution.

## Compiler Preprocessing

During the preprocessing stage, the compiler processes directives and performs actions specified by them. This includes inclusion of header files, macro expansion, and conditional compilation.

Understanding preprocessor directives and their usage is fundamental in C programming, as they play a crucial role in code organization, modularity, and platform independence.

# Understanding the `int main()` Function in C

In C programming, the `int main()` function serves as the entry point of a C program. It is where the program begins its execution. Let's break down each part of `int main()`:

## `int`

- `int` is the return type of the `main()` function. It indicates that the function returns an integer value to the calling environment (the operating system).
- Conventionally, a return value of `0` indicates successful execution, while a non-zero value indicates an error.

## `main()`

- `main()` is the name of the function. It is a special function in C and must be present in every C program.
- The parentheses `()` denote that `main` is a function and can accept arguments. However, in the simplest form, `main()` typically doesn't accept any arguments for most basic programs.
- `main()` is the function where the program starts its execution. When the program is executed, the control jumps to the `main()` function and starts executing the statements inside it.

### Putting It Together

So, when we put `int` and `main()` together, `int main()` declares a function named `main` that returns an integer value. This function is the entry point of the C program.

Here's a basic example demonstrating the usage of `int main()`:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
    return 0; // Indicates successful execution
}
```
