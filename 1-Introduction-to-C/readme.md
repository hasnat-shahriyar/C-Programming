# Introduction to C Programming

Welcome to the Introduction to C Programming! In this directory, I'll cover some very basic fundamental concepts of C programming.

## Including Standard Input-Output Header

In C programming, the `#include <stdio.h>` directive is commonly used to include the standard input-output header file. This directive is a preprocessor command that instructs the compiler to include the contents of the `stdio.h` header file before compiling the program. Here's a breakdown:

### `#include <stdio.h>`

- This line is a preprocessor directive.
- It tells the compiler to include the `stdio.h` header file.
- `stdio.h` provides declarations for functions like `printf()` and `scanf()`, which are essential for input and output operations in C.

## Preprocessor Commands

C preprocessor commands begin with a `#` symbol. They are used for various tasks such as including header files, defining constants, and conditional compilation. Here's a brief overview:

- **Header Inclusion**: `#include <header_file>` is used to include header files.
- **Macro Definition**: `#define CONSTANT_NAME value` is used to define constants.
- **Conditional Compilation**: Directives like `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#if`, `#else`, and `#endif` are used for conditional compilation.
- **Text Substitution**: `#define` with macros is used for text substitution.

## Compiler Preprocessing

During the preprocessing stage, the compiler processes directives and performs actions specified by them. This includes inclusion of header files, macro expansion, and conditional compilation.

Understanding preprocessor directives and their usage is fundamental in C programming, as they play a crucial role in code organization, modularity, and platform independence.
