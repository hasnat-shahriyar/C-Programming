### Format Specifier

a. In computer programming, a format specifier is a special character sequence used to specify the format of input or output data when dealing with formatted strings. It defines how data should be interpreted or displayed.

b. Format specifiers are used in programming languages to indicate how a variable should be formatted when it is included in a string or output.

c. Format specifiers are commonly used in functions like `printf()` and `scanf()` in languages such as C, C++, and other related languages. Here are some common format specifiers:

- `%d`: Used for printing or scanning integers in decimal format.
- `%f`: Used for printing or scanning floating-point numbers.
- `%c`: Used for printing or scanning characters.
- `%s`: Used for printing or scanning strings.
- `%x`, `%X`: Used for printing or scanning integers in hexadecimal format.
- `%o`: Used for printing or scanning integers in octal format.
- `%p`: Used for printing pointers.
- `%u`: Used for printing or scanning unsigned integers.
- `%e`, `%E`: Used for printing floating-point numbers in scientific notation.

For example, in C programming:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num = 10;
    float pi = 3.14159;
    char letter = 'A';
    char str[] = "Hello";

    printf("Integer: %d\n", num);
    printf("Float: %f\n", pi);
    printf("Character: %c\n", letter);
    printf("String: %s\n", str);

    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```
Integer: 10
Float: 3.141590
Character: A
String: Hello
```

These format specifiers are placeholders that are replaced by the corresponding values during runtime, allowing for flexible formatting of input and output data.
